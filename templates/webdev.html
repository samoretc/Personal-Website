 During the summer of 2013, I was a part of the Rose-Hulman International Genetic Engineered Machine (iGEM) team. In brief, our project aimed to transform Yeast and E. Coli, so they would need each other to survive. As a part of the competition, we needed to build a website. I contributed to it, and  built the interactive simulation on the modeling page. </h4>
